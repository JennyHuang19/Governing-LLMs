# Governing-LLMs

I’m thinking about holding a conversation on the frameworks that large AI labs currently use to “guide model behavior”:
For instance,
Anthropic has an “AI constitution”: https://constitutional.ai/#definition
OpenAI relies on a “model spec”: https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html

I’ll start with a walkthrough of how frontier labs are currently executing this in practice, which I anticipate will spark some interesting discussion around the lack of rigor/scientific grounding that goes into these approaches. Then, i’ll plan a discussion on potential ways forward (for making this space more principled).
Recent works have also highlighted gaps between the principles AI companies are declaring and actual behaviors these models exhibit:
